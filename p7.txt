turnin code:  cs_p7


Write a C program that is the result of enhancing p7starter.c at the locations
marked with comments.  Note that it invokes the p7test function which can
be linked to via the file named  p7test.o  in our public directory.

p7test  bases its work on these env vars during testing:
    P7RC
    P7ABEND
Different env var names will be used during grading, but the basic funtionality
will remain the same.

At end of main, print two lines:

    NORMAL or ABEND
    signum or exitcode
    
NORMAL is printed if the child process terminated normally (exited), and 
ABEND  is printed if the child process terminated due to a signal.
The second line of output provides the associated signal number or exitcode.


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc.).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
	tar cvf p7.tar ./p7dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and run:
        rm -rf p7
        rm -f  *.o
        make
